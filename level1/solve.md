# Level 1 - Target Reference Point 🛰️ GEOINT (OSINT)
## Challenge Summary
Identify a lake from a given satellite image
## Solution
I attempted to do a reverse image search on the given image using google lens but couldn't reach the right answer. I later resorted to brute-force by scanning the entire map using https://satellites.pro/ which took me some time before finding out that the name of the lake is Melintang in Indonesia
After the challenge is over, I realised that I could have simply rotated the given satellite image then perform a reverse image search to get the answer.

**Flag**: {lake_melintang}
